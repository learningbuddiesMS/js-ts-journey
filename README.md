## 🎯 Daily Tasks
Each day includes:
1. Learning new concepts
2. Implementing examples
3. Solving coding challenges
4. Taking notes
5. Writing summaries
6. Optional: GitHub tasks

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/learningbuddiesMS/js-ts-journey.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project:
   ```bash
   cd js-ts-journey
   ```

3. Set up the learning environment:
   ```bash
   # Create all day folders and files
   ./scripts/setup.sh
   
   # Create milestones for tracking progress
   ./scripts/create-milestones.sh
   
   # Create GitHub issues for all days
   ./scripts/create-issues.sh
   ```

   Note: To use the GitHub-related scripts, you need to:
   - Install GitHub CLI: https://cli.github.com/
   - Authenticate with: `gh auth login`
   - Have proper repository permissions

## 📝 Progress Tracking

Progress is tracked through GitHub issues and milestones:

### 🎯 Milestones
The journey is divided into four main phases:
1. **JavaScript Fundamentals** (Days 01-14)
2. **TypeScript & Advanced Concepts** (Days 15-30)
3. **Advanced Web Development** (Days 31-60)
4. **Real-world Projects** (Days 61-90)

Each issue is assigned to its corresponding milestone, helping you track progress through each phase.
